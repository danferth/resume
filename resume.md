# Intro

Originally trained in fine art photography and moving to print design and then web development I have seen the process from all angles and know the details each block of the process needs to contribute to a finished job.  Being able to take a project from light bulb to polished web and print marketing in a solo or team environment enables me to take on any aspect of a job whether it be design, front end development and even a some back end coding.  I enjoy both working on a project in its entirety, as well as concentrating on a single step in the process. 

*...Either way the goal is to complete a task on time and to blow the client and user out of there seat with the finished product.
Skills and Badges (...don’t need no stinking badges)*

## Front end gibber gabber
-	HTML
-	CSS (yes, know the sass thing)
-	gulp/grunt (gulp ftw!)
-	javascript (vanila & jQuery)
-	Greensock (animation is a good thing)
-	PHP (not only WP but I can just code with it too!)
-	MYSQL
-	Apache (can install, setup and configure your web server) 
### Frameworks and such
-	Foundation (got to have one under your belt and I like this one)
-	Bootstrap (not yet just give me a project to work on and boom!)
-	Wordpress (not only CSS but the PHP part too!)
-	AngularJS (just enough to get myself into trouble but enough JS to get me out of trouble)
### Design Stuff
-	Ball point pen and paper (design always starts here)
-	Illustrator, Photoshop, …… (programs are tools and tools can easily be used by the craftsman)
-	InDesign (for books and multiple page jobs)
-	I also have tons of talent calibrating monitors and printers, have not only worked with large format but can handle working with outside vendors to get what needs to be done and have it look freaking good to boot. Paper choice and going with modern and fancy pants printing is worth it bit if the client wants bargain basement paper stock I can make that work to.  Just have to be creative about it.
