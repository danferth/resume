##Experience

**Front end Web developer | illustrator at Thomson Instrument Comapny**

*September 2010 - Present (4 years 11 months)*

I get to don many hats here. Some days photo & video at labs for application notes, others are filled with engineering drawings for product prototypes, then again might be creating illustrations or front end web development. All in all great company to work for, learn something new everyday.

**Web Developer/Graphic Designer at AK illustrations**

*September 2009 - September 2010 (1 year 1 month)*

Started this company to provide support for clients I gathered at Sign A Rama. Instead of signs though the work was primarily web development and illustration. A great learning experience and a good lesson in paperwork and the tax code was gathered during this endeavor. Unfortunately One client Thomson Instrument Company wanted me full time in there marketing department so I closed the doors to paperwork and took a 9-5. More time with the kids now!
